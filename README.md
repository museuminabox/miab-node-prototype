# miab-node-prototype

This is a bunch of very scrappy code while I feel my way around the edges of what node can do on a PI.

The main aims are to...

1. Play sound.
2. Read RFID tags.
3. Write RFID tags.
4. ...
5. Profit?

One the 1st three are done, then I'll try tying them all together to close the loop.
